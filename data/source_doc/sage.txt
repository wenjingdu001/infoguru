Evaluating Sage Intacct
Migrating to a new platform is an important step for any organization and rarely a decision that should be made in
isolation, given the interconnectedness of processes and systems. Every important system participates in an overall
process, and the more seamless the process, the more the system can be automated and scaled. Below are some
factors to consider:
Platform trajectory
When adopting any new software, you’ll want to
evaluate where the software and vendor are headed. Is
the company making significant investments in its platform to improve
its solutions? Is the company adapting and evolving its software to
adjust to continually changing market factors? Sage Intacct makes
new updates every quarter, constantly upgrading and delivering
innovative new features. Sage Intacct is always listening to its
customers, improving its platform and moving in a forward trajectory.
Full suite of tools
Sage Intacct offers many solutions that can be
purchased individually or together to form a multicloud environment. The big advantage of a platform is that data is
consolidated in one layer so the growth, support and administration of
the platform become less expensive with the economics of scale and
scope. With cloud solutions, procuring a software solution is easy to
do and can be done in phases.
Upgradeability
This refers to how often the vendor provides
updates to the software and how easy those
upgrades are to implement. Sage Intacct’s developers are
committed to continually expanding and improving the software.
Updates arrive every single quarter. And unlike most other
vendors’ updates, these aren’t small tweaks. Each Sage Intacct
update gives users new tools, smarter interfaces and significant
improvements, many of which are informed by user feedback.
Cloud-based solution
While cloud-based solutions require configuration,
they can be implemented relatively quickly and cost
less than on-premises solutions. A phased approach may have
more costs, as it may be necessary to do more integration work,
but cloud solutions are designed to be flexible, and APIs enable
interoperability.

Finding the right implementation
provider is as important as finding
the right software—a good provider
can save you a lot of time, money and
unnecessary difficulty. Moreover, a good
provider can also help your company
maximize the value of using Sage Intacct
both now and in the long term. Thus,
it’s essential to find the right fit who
has significant in-house experience
in implementing it and understands
your organization’s business needs,
challenges, goals and industry well
enough to align Sage Intacct with your
business.
Choosing an
implementation
provider
Working with RSM is one
of the best investments
that SSH has made.
Yes, it’s outsourcing,
but I really see it as an
extension of our staff.
Alone, we could not manage
the work that they do.

Implementation checklist
Prepare and plan for your Sage Intacct implementation with this checklist of considerations:
How much historical data does your organization plan to
migrate? Who will be responsible for preparing your data?
Who at your organization will have decision-making
responsibility during deployment? Many decisions need to be
made in the first days of deployment that are crucial to the
configuration, so will these individuals be readily available?
What is the expectation for the go-live time frame?
Be sure to account for the complexity of your business
and the modules to be implemented.
How many individuals will be using the system?
How many will be full-access users?
What is your current chart of accounts (COA) structure?
Do you plan to reevaluate your COA structure during the
implementation? You should give serious consideration to
simplifying your COA using Sage Intacct dimensions.
Do you have a single corporate entity, or do
you have multiple tax ID requirements?
Are financial reports segmented across business divisions,
departments, locations, territories or lines of business?
Understanding the reporting structure is crucial for ensuring
the new system is configured to meet your reporting needs.
It would be helpful if you could provide samples of current
financial reports.
What processes are inadequate in your current system and
why? What are your objectives in moving to a new system?
Will any third-party integrations be required?
What does this third-party software currently provide?
What dimensions will be used in Sage Intacct?
What needs to be tracked or reported? Possibilities
include location, department, class, item or project.

Below are some of the top industries that RSM serves with Sage Intacct:
Nonprofit: Sage Intacct is uniquely suited to meet the accounting needs
of not-for-profits, from charities and faith-based organizations to trade
and membership associations and cultural and educational institutions.
The AICPA’s preferred provider of cloud financial applications, Sage Intacct
streamlines grant fund, project and donor accounting while delivering realtime visibility into the metrics that matter.
Family offices: Whether your clients want to check their investments
or review their philanthropic strategies, you can use Sage Intacct to put

covered. If your healthcare organization is eligible, Sage Intacct will enter into
a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) themselves with your organization.

complicated—and consequently more inefficient. Sage Intacct not only
helps your franchise business grow efficiently, but also improves and
simplifies consolidations, reducing time needed from days to minutes. This
grants more visibility across multiple locations, erasing data silos.

EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
Tip:
Most EFT file formats can be used for AP Vendors/Suppliers, AR Customers and Employee payments, if
you are using the same EFT File specifications from the bank.
If using both AP and AR Payments for the same bank, you need to add two EFT bank records, one for
Payment type and one for Receipt type. Both EFT Banks can use the same EFT File type.
For Employee Expenses Payments, you use a bank of type Payment.
EFT Bank Company Details
Many file formats require some company address details.
When generating the file, EFT Processing uses the details on EFT Bank for the selected EFT File Format.
Note: It is best practice to update the details for each bank.
To setup default values, you can copy the details from the Sage Intacct Company Information and
amend them for the specific bak / format if required.
You need to have the required Sage Intacct security rights on the Company to read the address.

{mm} or {MM} month number, e.g. ‘02'
{yy} or {YYYY} two digit year, e.g. ‘22’
{yyyy} or {YYYY} four digit year, e.g. ‘2022’
{n} run number per day, e.g. '2': {n} starts at 1 each day, and goes up by 1
for each file per bank and file type. Incremented by 1 for each downloaded file.
Setup EFT Processing Page 33 of 110
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
Run number is reset to 1 the next day.
{s} 1 digit file sequence number, e.g. 2
Adds one each time a file is generated for the bank. The FSN is displayed on the
EFT Bank record. See below.
FSN
File Sequence Number (FSN)
Use {s} in the file name.
The value is incremented by 1 per bank per generated file (not per download).
Example: If you have 2 EFT records for the bank for different file types, the FSN is
synchronized on both records for the bank.
If used, the bank expects the file sequence number to increase by one for each
upload.
Tip:
If this is the first time you are uploading an EFT File for this bank - then set it to 1.
If you have already uploaded files, you should set the FSN (File Sequence Number) to the next sequence number based on the last file you uploaded for this
bank.
The File Sequence Number is updated when you generate the EFT file.
Users who Generate the EFT File need to have security rights to update
EFT Bank as the FSN is stored on the EFT Bank record.
If a user doesn't have rights to EFT Banks and uses a file format that requires FSN,
they may get an error message like below: 
Warning! Permission Denied delete on EFT Bank. Please check with your administrator.
Tip: If you need to reexport a file, set the file sequence number back by 1 to
generate the file with the same number.
Bank Extra 1 to 9 The rest of the EFT Bank fields (Bank Extra 1..9) are turned on and renamed
Page 34 of 110 Setup EFT Processing
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
depending on the File Type selected for this bank.
Making a file name unique
Many banks require the EFT file name to be unique.
Depending on how you often you process a file, you can use a combination of the date, the File
Sequence Number and the daily run number to make the file unique,
To have a unique file number if you generate multiple files for the bank on a given day, you can use a
hard coded text (e.g. myfile) and fields in curly brackets/braces in any order in your naming convention: 
Example:
myfile.{yyyy}{mm}{dd}-{s}-{n}.txt
If you generate a file on 2023/06/14, and the FSN for the bank is set to 5:
the first file downloaded on the day will be called myfile.20230614-5-1.txt,
the next file downloaded the same day will be called myfile.20230614-6-2.txt
The next day, the file will be called myfile.20230615-7-1.txt

TIPS WHEN IMPORTING EFT DETAILS
Overview
Because the fields depend on the EFT format you use, it is best to enter one record manually for your
bank's file type, export the records. You can then update the csv file and import back on Sage Intacct.
EFT Processing adds the following fixed fields to AP/AR and Employee records: 
EFT_ACCNAME, EFT_ACCNO, EFT_BANKNAME, EFT_BIC, EFT_BSBNO, REFT_FORMAT (you must
import the EFT File Format Name) and EFT_IBAN.
In addition to the fixed fields, there are 50 “Extra” fields which are turned on when you select an
EFT File format. The first 10 fields are called EXTRA1, EXTRA2, EXTRA3, EXTRA4, EXTRA5, EXTRA6,
EXTRA7, EXTRA8, EXTRA9 and EXTRA10.
Extra11, Extra12.... Extra50 are contained in a single database field called EFT_EXTRA.
Key Steps
Detailed steps for AP Vendors/Suppliers and AR Customers are described in the links below: 
Importing EFT Vendor details on page 40
Import EFT Customer details on page 45
Importing File format
To import the EFT file format (REFT_FORMAT), you use the actual EFT File Type name, not the EFT File
Format ID which is exported.
File format with more than 10 fields
If your file format has more than 10 fields, there are additional steps.
You can import data directly into all the fixed fields and EFT_EXTRA1 to EFT_EXTRA10.
If you need data in Extra11 and up, you will need to “join” the data according to the rules below, and
import all the fields into EFT_EXTRA.
Please contact Orchid support for details.
Excel tip
Excel automatically converts the numeric field as number and dropped '0' in front. We recommend to
rename the file as .txt and open it manually in Excel and set the relevant columns as Text, for example
with the various bank and account number fields that may start with a 0.

SAVING EFT FILES TO CLOUD SERVICES
Why use Cloud Services?
Cloud service platforms offer enhanced security and additional workflow features for efficient file management. By uploading EFT Files to a cloud service drive such as Box.com, OneDrive, Dropbox, Google
Drive, etc., you can leverage these features.
When utilizing Orchid's EFT Processing for Sage Intacct to download EFT Files, they are typically saved in
the designated download directory of your browser. This directory can either be the default one or a specific location that you have set up.
Depending on your browser, you have the option to configure multiple profiles, each associated with a
distinct download directory. This flexibility allows you to:
Have one profile to download files to the default "downloads" directory: Use this profile to download non-EFT File downloads, and;
Create another profile that you use with Sage Intacct: Use this to download EFT Files to a specified
directory. You can then configure this directory to be a cloud service managed directory.
KEY STEPS
Step 1: Install the Cloud Service application on the workstation to map to the cloud service platform
Step 2: Install/configure the cloud service tool (e.g. Google Drive) on the appropriate workstation
Step 3: Configure the "downloads" directory for the required browser profile to be the EFT File Folder
(e.g. using Microsoft Edge)
Step 4: Use the EFT Profile to log on to Sage Intacct
Step 5: When you download the EFT File using the EFT Profile, the file will automatically be saved on
the cloud service drive.
Step 6: The Cloud service application will sync the file to the Cloud Service platform, using the Cloud
Service platform security settings.
The video below demonstrates using EFT Processing with Cloud Services and the setup required.

EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
SAVING AN EFT FILE TO A SFTP SERVER
Why use SFTP?
Using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) offers several advantages when it comes to EFT (Electronic
Funds Transfer) Processing. SFTP is a secure and encrypted protocol that ensures the confidentiality and
integrity of data during file transfers.
Many EFT Processing users configure an SFTP Server to save the file before uploading it to the banking
software. Some banks provide access to an SFTP server to upload the files. You can discuss this option
with your bank.
SFTP WITH EFT PROCESSING (SAGE INTACCT)
All processes in EFT Processing for Sage Intacct occur in the user's browser and browsers don't support
SFTP. Orchid EFT doesn't do any processing on a server outside of the browser, so we cannot add any
SFTP configuration in EFT itself.
If you want to save the file to an SFTP server, you can use a program to map a drive in Windows Explorer
to your SFTP server. A similar method is available with Mac OS.
As the EFT File is downloaded based on the browser configuration, you can configure your browser to
download to that mapped drive. This will save the file to the SFTP server.
It is advisable to setup different browser profiles, one to download to the SFTP Mapped drive, one for
general downloads.
STEP 1 - MAP A DRIVE TO THE SFTP SITE
Page 64 of 110 Using EFT: Overview and Tips
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
You need to install utilities to map a drive to the SFTP Site. There are various options depending on your
operating system and your exact requirements. There are open-source programs as well as paid options.
STEP 2 : SET DOWNLOAD PATH IN BROWSER TO THE MAPPED DRIVE
You can configure the browser to "Prompt" to download or have an "EFT Profile" where you configure
the download folder to be the SFTP Mapped drive (in our example E drive).
STEP 3: DOWNLOAD THE EFT FILE
In EFT Processing > EFT File List, select a file and choose Download.
If you set the location to the mapped drive, the file is saved in the folder automatically.
STEP 4 - CHECK THE FTP SITE
When testing, you can use Filezilla or other FTP software to check that the file is available on the FTP site.
CREATING A PRENOTE FILE
Prenote (prenotification) is a process that creates a zero-dollar transaction/prenote transaction type file
for the bank as a test that the vendor's and employee's EFT details are setup correctly. The prenote file
can be generated in one of two ways, depending on how you control the process:
Control the process from the EFT Vendor(s) record - Method 1
Control the process from the EFT Bank record - Method 2
Refer to video presentation on Orchid website.
https://www.orchid.systems/resources/video/spotlight-creating-prenote-files-sage-intacct-eft-processing
Using EFT: Overview and Tips Page 65 of 110
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
WHEN TO SEND A PRENOTE FILE?
There are no exact rules for doing prenotes.
Since the prenote is a verification of banking details, most users would create a prenote file the first time
you pay a vendor. If this is the only time you want to send a prenote file, we recommend Method 1
although you need to generate, delete & re-generate the EFT File for each new vendor.
Some users might want to generate a prenote file for each EFT File and then generate the file with the
actual payment amount on a regular basis. If this is what you want to do, we recommend Method 2. With
this method you only need to generate, download, hold, refresh after changing the EFT Bank Prenote
flag to "N", and download the new EFT file.
Refer to Sage website:
https://www.sage.com/en-us/blog/glossary/what-is-a-prenote/
EFT FILE FORMATS FOR PRENOTES
There are different EFT File Formats for the various banks with the same functionality described below. In
the examples below, we will use
NACHA
NACHA_PRENOTE
If there is no prenote format for your specific bank - send us the specification for the PreNote file from
the bank, and we can include the format for you.
Page 66 of 110 Using EFT: Overview and Tips
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
METHOD 1 - FROM THE EFT VENDOR RECORD
Step 1: Configure the appropriate bank in EFT Banks to be linked to NACHA and NACHA_PRENOTE.
You will have two EFT Banks records for the appropriate bank account
Step 2: On the Orchid EFT Tab for the Vendor, select NACHA_PRENOTE as the EFT File Type and fill in
the appropriate EFT Fields for the vendor (bank account number, bank branch number, account type)
Step 3: When you have a posted payment for this Vendor, Use EFT AP Payment Request to select the
payment for the vendor and Generate an EFT File
Step 4: Use EFT File List to download the EFT File. This file will have zero for the payment amounts, and
the account type will be set to prenote.
Step 5: Upload the EFT File to the bank, and when confirmed by the bank
Delete the EFT File in EFT File List
Amend the EFT Vendor details, change the NACHA_PRENOTE EFT File Type to NACHA
Step 6: Use EFT AP Payment Request to select the payment for the vendor and Generate EFT File, this
time, the file created with NACHA file type will include the payment amount and transaction type.
METHOD 2 - FROM THE EFT BANK RECORD
Configure the appropriate bank in EFT Banks to be linked to NACHA You will have one record in
EFT Banks for the appropriate bank account
On the Orchid EFT Tab for the Vendor, select NACHA as the EFT File Type and fill in the appropriate
EFT Fields for the vendor (bank account number, bank branch number, account type: cheque or
savings)
When you have a posted payment for this Vendor and want to create a PRENOTE file
Step 1: On EFT Banks, set the Prenote indicator to "Y". Save the EFT Bank Record
Step 2: Use EFT AP Payment Request to select the payment for the vendor and Generate an
EFT File. Include any other vendor payments for which you want to generate a prenote for
Step 3: Use EFT File List to download the EFT File. This file will have zero for the payment
amounts, and the account type will be set to prenote.
Step 4: Upload the EFT File to the bank, and when confirmed by the bank
Step 5: Hold the EFT File in EFT File List
Step 6: On EFT Banks, set the Prenote indicator to "N". Save the EFT Bank Record
Using EFT: Overview and Tips Page 67 of 110

generate and post the AP Advances using standard Sage Intacct functionality.
2. In EFT Processing, use the EFT  AP Payment Requests screen to select AP Payments and Advances
to be included in an EFT File.
3. Generate the file on the EFT  AP Payment Requests screen.
4. Use EFT File List to view the file and download it on your machine. You can filter by file type to
select Payment only for AP Payments .
5. You can then import the file into the banking software / application.
6. When the bank confirms the upload is successful, confirm the file to finalize the Payment process.
7. If required, Hold the file if any transactions are rejected, update the data and refresh the file.
8. You can use the standard Sage Intacct process to email remittance advices if required.
Page 68 of 110 Using EFT Processing with AP

Orchid EFT for AP.
EFT AP PAYMENT REQUEST
The screen includes AP Payments and Advances that have been entered, approved and completed
through the standard Sage Intacct processes, for vendors where the EFT File Format is set on the Orchid
EFT Tab. Payments made for Credit Card and Savings banks are excluded.
How to Use the screen
You can use this screen to select payments to be included in an EFT File or to view the payments already
included in a file.
To create a new EFT File
By default, the screen shows completed posted payments for vendors configured for EFT that are not

Select the payments you want to include in an EFT File.
Tip:
In the bottom right corner of the screen, you can view the number of records and the running total of the selected records to assist in validating the records selected against control
total.
You can then GENERATE the EFT file. Refer to Generate EFT files on page 71
Using EFT Processing with AP Page 69 of 110
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
To view payments in a file
For details on using the screen to view Payments in a file, refer to View AP payments in EFT File on
page 78.
Step 1. Complete AP Payments using standard Sage Intacct processes
You need to create the AP Payments using the standard Sage Intacct processes. EFT Processing can
include completed posted payments for any payment methods (Record Transfers, Checks/Cheques, cash
and Advances).
Using Record Transfer payment method
Record Transfer is commonly used when you want to generate EFT Files for the payments.
You can use other payment method for payments that don't require an EFT File and filter by payment
method on the AP Payment request screen.
Note: There is no feature to auto-number Record Transfers, so you need to copy the memo field and
add digits to make the document number unique manually.
Using Check payment method
If you are doing Checks, you need to print the checks for the payments to be posted. You can then
include the payment in a positive pay EFT File as required by the bank.
Using ACH/Bank File payment method
If you use ACH or bank file, Sage Intacct creates separate payment records. You need to create, download and confirm the EFT File with the Sage Intacct standard process as this is required to post the
AP Payments.
Note: Do not upload the standard file to the bank.
Posted payments are then available on the AP Payment Request screen to generate a new file using
Orchid EFT Processing and the required format.
Page 70 of 110 Using EFT Processing with AP
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
Tip:
Use ACH Payment method if the standard process EFT File format is not compatible with
your bank's requirements, but you want to use some of the standard process's features to
number payments: 
Users are prompted for a “payment reference” which gets copied to “memo” on the
payment when they select an invoice to be paid an
auto-numbering of the Doc No. on the payment.
These fields can then be used in the bank reconciliation.
Payment approval and processes
If approval is enabled in your site, you need to approve the payments. Once approved,
they are posted and available on the AP Payment Request screen.
You can use Pay Now or Outbox depending on your process. Payments in the Sage
Intacct Outbox are not included in the EFT AP Payment Request list. You need to pay the
bill on the Outbox, approve and post the payment as per the standard process.
Step 2. Add Records to Generate an EFT File
Select not in any EFT File to view payments available.
Use the tick box next to Vendor ID to select/deselect all records.
You can also select payments individually.
Note: If you can't find a payment you want to pay, check that the vendor is configured for
EFT and that the payment is confirmed and posted.
Note: If the Format is crossed out, it generally means that the bank is not configured for
the selected format. Hover over the field for a description of the issue.
Step 3. Generate EFT files
Use the Generate button to create EFT Files for the selected payment records. EFT Processing creates
one file per bank and per EFT File Format for the selected records.
Note: If there are any validation errors, review the message, update the required data and
try generating the file again.
Tip: The screen displays "In Progress" messages to indicate that processing is yet to complete.
Using EFT Processing with AP Page 71 of 110
EFT Processing for Sage Intacct
Tip: EFT Processing displays a message with the number of files generated.
Filtering records
Tips when using filters:
The screen filters to 1 month ago by default.
Filters are saved from a prior session in the browser.
If the column heading is in italic, it means there is an active filter. Check the filter if you can't find
the records you are looking for.
Fields available to filter by:
You can filter by any fields on the first row, by selecting from the list of values or using a filter
string.
Vendor/Customer/Employee Types and Payment Created by are available to use as filters.
When working at Entity Level in Sage Intacct
If working in Sage Intacct at the Entity Level, the Payment Created by only shows the user
name for payments created by the logged on user. The payment is displayed in the list, but the
created by field is blank.
If you have security rights at the top level, you can view and filter by the Created By name for
all users.

CREATING POSITIVE PAY FILES
WHEN TO SEND A POSITIVE PAY FILE?
Positive Pay is a process that you need to send an EFT File for the bank for the checks/cheques you have
issued. Without the matching details between the physical check/cheque and the details loaded to the
bank, the bank will not honour the check/cheque. The Positive Pay file can be generated from the Printed
Check entries in the AP Posted Payments.
Note: The positive pay file should be generated and uploaded to the bank prior to the checks/cheques being posted out.
Refer to video on the Orchid website:
https://www.orchid.systems/resources/video/spotlight-positive-pay-files-sage-intacct
or on Youtube

Beginners Guide to Sage 200
In Business Management Software, Sage 200 by Callum EdwardsMarch 29, 2023

Reading Time: 8 minutes
If you’re a new user of Sage 200 then you’ve come to the right place. Whenever you learn a new skill it can seem like a daunting task. Whether it’s being taught how to drive a car, teaching yourself how to bake for the first time, or even learning to use accountancy software. This guide is here to help ease your worries with some helpful hints and tips to get you on your way to becoming a Sage 200 pro.

The first thing you must know is that Sage 200 is a business management solution for small to medium businesses. It allows users to tailor the system to their individual business process needs. There are two versions of Sage 200, Sage 200 Professional and Sage 200 Standard.

Sage 200 Professional
Sage 200 Professional is the big sister of the two and has a bit more functionality, it requires either an on-premise or hosted server and uses a SQL database to store its data. Depending on your company’s needs, you can also purchase add-ons directly from Sage or trusted 3rd party providers.

Sage 200 Standard
Sage 200 Standard is the younger brother, it’s a full cloud version of Sage and is run on Windows Azure. It has slightly less functionality, and fewer available add-ons but the two versions work and look virtually the same. There are some slight differences when navigating the two systems.

The images used in this blog are from Sage 200 Professional.

If you want to find out more about the different versions, you can read our blog here.

Everything a Sage 200 beginner needs to know before they get started 
Sage 200 tends to be split into different sections, and within these sections are modules. The core sections are split into Financials and Commercials. The Commercials modules feed into the Financials modules so that your organisation can run financial reports to get valuable information on how to improve the business.

Sage 200 is extremely customisable, so depending on the company’s license and your level of access, you may not have all of the features listed below. You may also have more modules if your company requires additional functionality. The modules listed below are the most common and out of the box from Sage.

Core Financials Consists of 4 Modules:-
Sales Ledger or Customers (A section to look after all of your customer’s information, including balances, transactions, and reporting.)
Purchase Ledger or Suppliers (This is where all of your Supplier’s information is kept, including balances and transactions, and reporting.)
Nominal Ledger (The Chart of Accounts (COA) is kept here. Sage 200 has a 3-tier structure for the COA, which is extremely useful for reporting. Within this ledger is a module for Fixed Assets, for keeping a record of the company’s assets value and depreciation.)
Cash Book (This is where all of your company’s bank information is kept.)
Core Commercials Consist of 5 Modules:-
Stock Control (This is where you can account for the goods and services that your organisation provides. Keep a track of your inventory levels and movements etc..)
Sales Order Processing (A place to keep track of your customers’ sales orders, you can record the order, print out customer-facing documents, and more. Links to the stock module.)
Purchase Order Processing (Similar to sales order processing but for the purchase of goods from suppliers. Links to the stock module.)
Invoicing (This module is for looking after customer invoices and credit notes. Links to the sales order processing module.)
Price Book (The price book module is used for assigning prices to your stock items for use in sales orders.)
Within each of these modules, there is a lot of functionality and reporting. Sage has over 200+ reports out of the box.

Now you know a bit more about the modules, let’s take a look at navigating them.

New call-to-action

Navigating Sage 200
Home Screen
When you first open the Sage 200 application you will be brought to the home screen.

Sage Home Screen

This screen contains useful links and information, such as a link to Sage’s roadmap which allows you to see the direction Sage is heading with their software and updates they plan for the future.

This also has links to websites with information on current regulations and how to deal with them in Sage. There are tabs at the top of the home screen, one is called Getting Started, which contains some useful tips and also videos you can watch to help you get the most out of Sage.

On the left-hand side of the screen, you will see the list of all the modules that are available to you. If you don’t see a certain module, this is probably because it has not been assigned to you. If you believe this is wrong, you will need to speak to your system administrator to update your user role.

Left-click on one of the modules, and you will get a dropdown as you can see in the image below, you have functions and sub-folders which are clearly labeled. You also have a search menu bar, if you type a keyword into there and press enter on your keyboard, it will pull back anything from the menu containing that keyword.

Sales Ledger Functions

Process Maps
Each Module also has a handy process map that is drillable. It goes through the process of the ledger from start to finish, from creating an account to entering transactions and so on.

Sales Ledger Process Map

List Views
Every module usually has a list view, which contains basic information from that ledger. This is the customer list from the sales ledger (Pictured below). There is a toolbar across the top of the list, the toolbar is interactive. To enter the desired function just left-click on the icon. You can also left-click on an account to highlight it in the list, if you then use the toolbar it will work for the selected account, i.e. if you highlight an account and click invoice, this will raise an invoice for the selected account.

You have another search function on the list view (The white bar), enter keywords or values into here and press enter, it will search all of the columns on the list and show the relevant information.

Customer List

Reports
Under the reports section of a module, there are subfolders to help separate the many reports. When running a report, you will see a criteria screen pop up. You can either run the full report or filter by the criteria on the screen to help find the exact information you’re looking for.

Top tips for new users of Sage 200
Help Tip
Probably the most useful tip of them all. In the top right corner of every screen in Sage 200, you will see a question mark icon. If you’re unsure about any of the information on your screen in Sage 200, click the help icon and you will be taken to Sage’s help site. Not only that but it will link you directly to the information you need depending on the screen you’re in.

In the example below, I am in the Sales Ledger – Enter New Account screen, in the contacts tab, if I were to click the help icon, it would direct me to the information about that exact screen and tab.

Report Tips
When you first start using Sage 200, if you run a report it will save to something called the spooler. The spooler can be accessed at the top right-hand corner of Sage 200 (It looks like a printer with a magnifying glass). From here, you can view, print or email a report.



 

Spooler

If you want the report to appear straight away on the screen when you run it, you can change the settings using the settings cog in the top right-hand corner. (Located next to the spooler icon.) If you click ‘Choose Output Mode‘ and set it to ‘Preview‘ the report. The report will show straight away instead of saving to the spooler.

Settings Cog

From the settings cog, you can also change your preferences and if you have access to multiple companies, you can switch between companies.

Once you’ve run a report in the top left-hand corner you have a few options. You can print, email, export and even send the data in an excel format.

Report options

List View Tips
The list views in Sage 200 are customisable, when on a list view if you right-click anywhere on the list you can add or remove columns of information as you desire. You can also left-click on the column headers and drag them left to right to arrange the data. These customisations will only happen in your own Sage 200 system, it will not change the list views for anybody else.

Add Columns to List Views

Menu Tips
If you have particular menu items that you use regularly, you can add them to your favorites. The favorites are located at the top of the menu on the left, it is a star icon. For example, if your role on the accounts team is to enter Sales Orders, you may want to favorite the ‘Enter New Order‘ function in sales order processing.

To add menu items to your favorites, locate the function in the menu and right-click on it, there you will see the option to add to your favorites.

Add to Favourites

To view your favorites, click on the star at the top. You can also create folders and rename your functions in the favorites menu. To do this click on the pencil to the right of the star.

Favourites

This will allow you to edit your favorites, click the plus button to add a new folder and name it, then hit enter on your keyboard.

Left-click on your favorite functions, then drag and drop them into the folders.  To remove a favorite, highlight it and click the red cross.

Once you are finished hit the cross in the top right to save your amendments.

Sage Intacct: Empowering Fast-Growing SaaS Companies Through Unparalleled Financial Management
In Business Management Software, Sage Intacct by Mark BlackmoreFebruary 6, 2024

Reading Time: 4 minutes
The world of Software as a Service (SaaS) is a fast-paced changing one, where agility and precision are paramount, finding a comprehensive financial management solution that caters to the unique needs of rapidly expanding companies is crucial. Enter Sage Intacct – a game-changer in the realm of accounting, billing, and forecasting for fast-growing SaaS companies.  If you are a CFO of a SaaS business we suggest reading this post ‘Sage Intacct: Empowering Fast-Growing SaaS Companies’ to learn more.

In this blog post, we will highlight the distinctive features that set Sage Intacct apart, making it an indispensable ally for SaaS businesses aiming to streamline operations, reduce manual processes, and enhance overall efficiency.

Streamlining Financial Processes:
Automation and Accelerated Close Times:
Sage Intacct stands out in its ability to automate core financial management functions such as Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and the financial close. Automation not only reduces the risk of errors but also significantly speeds up the close times, allowing finance teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than tedious manual tasks.

Subscription Billing Mastery:
One of the standout features of Sage Intacct is its robust, contract-based subscription billing system. The platform handles multiple pricing methods seamlessly – from fixed and quantity-based to usage-based, discount tiers, overages, included units, and even time & materials. This flexibility ensures that billing aligns perfectly with your unique business model, providing clarity and precision in revenue recognition.

Efficient Order to Bill Cycle:

Sage Intacct excels in reducing the order-to-bill cycle time, ensuring that revenue streams are optimised. The automated quote-to-cash process, coupled with bi-directional native integration with Salesforce.com and Salesforce CPQ, ensures a seamless flow of information between sales and finance, eliminating bottlenecks and minimising delays.
