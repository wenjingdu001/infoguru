Overview
The Scoro API is an interface for accessing your Scoro account data using HTTP and JSON. The API makes it easy to create web and desktop applications that integrate with your account.

Some potential application ideas:

Billing for your application or service
Custom import tools (SalesForce, QuickBooks, CSV, etc.)
Revenue analysis
Service URL
The Scoro API has a single point of entry, derived from your account URL

Full url depends on the info requested.

Sample URL
https://#companyname#.scoro.com/api/v2
Please note the use of https:// in the URL above. All API communication is encrypted over HTTPS. Any non-secure requests are automatically rejected, so we recommend establishing a test connection with the secure API entry point before sending sensitive data.

Full address to send JSON requests looks like this

Full request url
https://#companyname#.scoro.com/api/v2/#module#(/#action#)(/#id#)
where
#companyname# is the subdomain
#module# is the module accessed ("contacts")
#action# (optional) what to do with the selected object. Possible options are ("modify", "delete", "view"), see each module for a list of available actions
#id# (optional) what object to get

Integrate with us
Build a public integration with Scoro
You can build your own integration with Scoro and list it in our Marketplace to make it available for all Scoro users.

Why build a public integration?
Your integration will be listed in Scoro's Marketplace, where it's showcased to Scoro customers and thousands of professional service businesses every month.
You will get access to your own sandbox for development and testing without any expiration date.
Scoro will announce the integration to its customers via its own channels to help you promote it.
Scoro will provide proactive support throughout development and help you manage errors once the integration is live.
How to get started?
To build a public integration with Scoro, follow the steps below:

Fill in this form to express your interest. We will contact you either by email or phone to validate your request.
While waiting for our response:
Create a trial account, which is free for 14 days, via our website. This way, you can already start developing and testing.
Create an account at developers.scoro.com to register your integration and generate an AppId. The AppId is a requirement for public integrations. It must be used as a HTTP header called "scoro-app-id" in all API calls that the integration is doing against Scoro servers:
scoro-app-id: AppId
If the scoro-app-id is wrong, or the AppId is not registered, a 401 Unauthorized HTTP error code will be returned.
Once your integration is ready, let us know by submitting it for review via the developers portal. We'll help you publish it in Scoro's Marketplace. We might ask you to provide additional descriptions or documentation before publication, depending on the complexity of your integration.

Request Limits
A maximum of 100 results will be returned for list methods, regardless of the value sent with the per_page parameter. The page paramater can be used to request additional items. When detailed_response is used, the maximum number of results will be 25.

Sample request with per_page and page parameters

{
    "apiKey": "API_hash",
    "lang": "eng",
    "company_account_id": "tutorial",
    "per_page": 50,
    "page": 2,
    "detailed_response": true,
    "request": {}
}

Sample request with user_token

{
    "user_token": "USER_API_token",
    "lang": "eng",
    "company_account_id": "tutorial",
    "per_page": 50,
    "page": 2,
    "detailed_response": true,
    "request": {}
}

Rate Limiting
We limit the rate of API requests to ensure reliable and responsive services for all our customers. It helps to prevent the system from getting overloaded and minimizes the risk of temporary performance issues.

The rate limit window duration is 2 seconds for any authentication method. We’ve also set a daily usage limit, which always resets at midnight UTC. The limits apply per site/domain and vary based on your chosen plan as follows:

Essential	Standard	Pro	Ultimate
2 sec limit	10	20	40	80
Daily limit	50,000	100,000	500,000	1,000,000
For example, if your Scoro site examplecompany.scoro.com is subscribed to a Pro plan, you can send 40 API requests per 2 seconds and 500,000 requests per 24 hours.

HTTP headers and response codes
Every API call will return a message containing the following headers:

Header	Description	Example
x-ratelimit-limit	The maximum number of requests per domain for every 2 second window	x-ratelimit-limit: 40
x-ratelimit-remaining	The number of requests left for the 2 second window	x-ratelimit-remaining: 39
x-ratelimit-reset	The time remaining in seconds before the rate limit is reset	x-ratelimit-reset: 1
x-daily-requests-limit	The maximum number of requests per domain for the day*	x-daily-requests-limit: 100000
x-daily-requests-remaining	The number of requests left for the day*	x-daily-requests-remaining: 99999
x-daily-requests-reset	The time remaining in seconds before the rate limit is reset for the day*	x-daily-requests-reset: 86400
* Daily limits reset at midnight UTC

Any request that comes after the limit has been reached is rejected and gets an HTTP 429 Too many request error code in response.

The response message will look like this:


Response
HTTP/1.1 429 Too many requests
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "statusCode": "429",
    "messages": {
        "error": [
            "Too many requests"
        ]
    }
}

What to do when the rate limit is reached and how to avoid it
If you reach the rate limit, consider using Webhooks to decrease the number of requests and/or upgrading your plan to increase the limit. Alternatively, you could review the architecture of your integration to see if the same result could be achieved with fewer requests.

In any case, your integration should be ready to handle the HTTP 429 error code and rate limit headers properly. Here is an example of a possible solution scenario in pseudocode:


let response = await fetch(...);
if (response is OK) {
  handleSuccess(...);
} else if (statusCode is 429) {
  if (headerValue('x-ratelimit-remaining') is 0) {
    delay(1000 * headerValue('x-ratelimit-reset'));
  } else if (headerValue('x-daily-requests-remaining') is 0) {
    delay(1000 * headerValue('x-daily-requests-reset'));
  } else {
    handleFailure(...);
  }
} else {
  handleOtherFailures(...);
}
			

Additional information
Zapier
Please note that API calls from Zapier are included in the rate limits. This means that Zapier will handle excessive API usage, which can result in your API calls becoming slower. Zapier will wait before retrying the API call. This might affect your workflow. To prevent any issues, we recommend adapting your architecture to reflect the limit of your subscription level. Our API rate limit is implementing a Retry-After functionality.

Webhooks
Webhooks are not subjected to rate limiting, but webhook endpoints are (subscribe, unsubscribe and list) since these are part of the API.

Representation Formats
All API requests are composed of light-weight JSON delivered as an HTTP POST request to the endpoint URL.

All JSON should be UTF-8 encoded.

Date and time values are of the form YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+0000.
When not providing timezone info in the value then site default timezone is used.

Booleans are either 1 (true) or 0 (false).

Fields denoting percentages are passed as whole values, not decimals (e.g. 5 for five percent).

All requests should contain at least the following values:

apiKey OR user_token- a unique key used for authentication
company_account_id - specifies which business entity’s data is used (formerly known as ‘company accounts’)
The apiKey and company_account_id values are listed in Settings > External Connections > API.

It is also recommended (but not required) that you specify the lang parameter for each response.
If the lang parameter is not set then the response is returned in sites default language.
If the lang parameter is not set and request is made using a user_token then the response is returned in users default language.

Sample request in PHP using cURL

<?php

	define('API_KEY', 'API_hash');
	define('BASE_URL', 'https://#companyname#.scoro.com/api/v2');

	$fields = array(
		'apiKey' => API_KEY,
		'lang' => 'eng',
		'company_account_id' => 'sample',
		'per_page' => '10'
	);
	$fieldsJson = json_encode($fields);

	$ch = curl_init();

	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, BASE_URL.'/contacts');
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fieldsJson);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

	$result = curl_exec($ch);
	if ($result) {
		$contacts = json_decode($result, true);
		?><pre><?print_r($contacts);?></pre><?
	}

?>
			

Responses
All responses are wrapped in a top-level response element. The status attribute will let you know whether the request succeeded or failed. Status can be OK or ERROR. The statusCode attribute can contain the following values:

Status code	Response message	Description
200	Success	If data was requested, it will be available in the data field at the top level of the response body.
400	Invalid request	This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again.
401	No authorization	A valid API key was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request.
403	Forbidden	The API key was wrong.
408	Request timed out	The maximum execution time of the request was reached.
429	Too many requests	The maximum number of requests was reached.
500	Server error	There was a problem on our end.
503	Service unavailable	API usage has been temporarily suspended. Try again later.
In the event of an error, the response body will contain an messages field at the top level. This contains an array of at least one error message

        }
    }
}

Custom fields
The field custom_fields contains the values for custom fields related to the main object. Custom_fields is structured as an array of objects with the following keys: id, name, value and type. Custom fields are not included for list requests. Please note, that if custom_field has a default value - it will be applied if no value is provided while creating a new object.

Example custom_fields structure:

{
    "...": "...",
    "custom_fields": [
        {
            "id": "c_field1",
            "name": "Field 1",
            "value": "Value 1",
