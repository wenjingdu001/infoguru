2-step verification helps to keep your data safe, by requiring you to verify your account via verification code sent to your mobile phone. 

Start by activating 2-step verification on your site. Before doing that, make sure your team is aware of this, as each team member will need to log in again and verify their account via mobile phone. 

Go to **Settings > Administration > Security settings** and just switch on the option **Use 2-step verification**.

Click **Next**. You should receive the code to your mobile phone via text message in a moment. Enter the code and click **Next**, again.

If, for some reason, you don't receive the code to your phone, click on **Send again** to receive a new one.

After entering the code, if everything went well, you've enabled the 2-step verification on your Scoro site.

Each user will then have to log in to Scoro again, verifying their account with the help of the code sent to their phone. After verification, they can see the list of trusted devices under **My settings > My security settings**.![My-security-settings.png](https://support.scoro.com/hc/article_attachments/13449850714381)They can change their **2-step verification phone number**, as well as set up a **session duration** – choose the time period the user stays logged into their account (if enabled by the administrator under **Settings > Administration > Security settings**).

**Note!** In case the mobile phone used to verify an account is lost, for example, the site administrator can reset the 2-step verification settings for this account. Go to **Settings > Administration > Users and groups** and open the relevant user profile.
