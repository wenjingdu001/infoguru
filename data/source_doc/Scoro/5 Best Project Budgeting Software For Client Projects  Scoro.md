## 1\. Scoro

[Scoro](https://www.scoro.com/) is the ideal platform for service businesses that are juggling multiple projects, clients, and staff members. Scoro’s project, expense, and time tracking features make it easy to keep your project on track and profitable. 

For example, Scoro’s “Project list” view allows you to track the status of and [manage multiple projects](https://www.scoro.com/blog/how-to-manage-multiple-projects/) at a portfolio level. This lets you easily see a snapshot of all your ongoing projects simultaneously.

![](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-of-a-list-of-projects-in-Scoro.png)

For each project, you can quickly see financial metrics like “Income,” “Labor cost” and “Project profit”— with each column listing the actual vs. estimate values. 

Helping you to compare original estimates and quotes with real-time actual costs and revenue. The data columns in this view are also completely customizable. For example, you can add metrics like “Average billable rate,” “Expenses,” and “Delivery margin”

You can click on any individual project from the “Project list” view for a more detailed analysis. You can view the project summary bar from here for an instant, real-time overview of resource and budget constraints.

![Screenshot of summary bar for a project in Scoro](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-of-summary-bar-for-a-project-in-Scoro.png)

It also allows you to track the ongoing progress of a project through due dates, milestones, and other metrics like:

-   **Time:** “Used hours (%),” “Used hours (h),” and “Remaining hours” (calculated based on tracked time against via Scoro’s time tracker, calendar, or timesheets)
-   **Monetary budget metric:** “Earned revenue” is calculated automatically based on logged hours and the selling price. For example, earned revenue is most likely equal to r_ecognized revenue_ for time and materials projects.
-   **Progress metrics:** “Remaining days” for the project and “Overdue tasks”

The “Budget” tab provides deeper visibility into a project’s financial progress. 

For example, the “Breakdown” tab displays a chart that detects potential overservicing and tracks time use across roles. This can help you reallocate specific tasks or projects to other team members to remain within budget.

![](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-showing-the-project-budget-tab-in-Scoro-.png)

Another helpful tool is the “Quoted vs Actual” table, which offers a complete overview of project financials. The table includes “Invoices,” “Profit,” “Progress” tracking, “Bills and expenses,” and more.

![](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-of-a-quoted-vs-actual-table-for-a-project-in-Scoro.png)

The table considers inputted [team labor rates](https://support.scoro.com/hc/en-us/articles/12383234670477-Quoted-vs-Actual-table#:~:text=Cost%2Drelated%20data-,Labor%20cost,-indicates%20roughly%20how) and [selling prices](https://support.scoro.com/hc/en-us/articles/12507214434445-Roles-and-role-based-prices). This can help you assess whether a project is progressing on budget at a service level and also lets you improve your scoping with retrospective analysis.

### What you’ll like

Scoro allows you to build project budgets during the quoting phase. You can then link a quote to a specific customer and add deliverables, prices and estimate costs. 

![](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-of-a-project-quote-in-Scoro.png)

You can then track your quotes using the “Pipeline” view.

Pipeline gives you an overview of the sales funnel and your team’s sales progress by quote statuses.

![](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot-of-Pipeline-view-in-Scoro.png)

-   **Resources required:** You can consider expenses like labor, role, and vendor rates 
-   **Potential profitability:** You can forecast potential income before committing to client work 
-   **Project expenses:** This might include necessary materials or equipment

All this data feeds into Scoro’s reports, including the “Revenue report.” Any changes to a project or quote will automatically update the report so you have a solid understanding of your revenue pipeline.

[Float](https://www.float.com/) is a resource management tool that centralizes people and projects into a single live timeline, making planning and assigning work based on the team’s capacity easier.

![Screenshot of schedule view in Float](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-of-schedule-view-in-Float-min.png)

But Float also helps you track project budgets with five different budget types.

-   **Hours by Project:** Set a total project hours budget (e.g. 100 hours). As your team logs hours, the total budget is deducted to show the remaining hours.
-   **Fee by Project:**  Input a dollar amount for the total project cost (e.g. $20,000). Also, set the team’s hourly rate(s). The corresponding fee is calculated and deducted from the budget as time is logged.
-   **Hourly Fee:** Specify an hourly rate for each team member. Tracks total cost based on per person rate x hours logged. Can customize rates per person or across the team.
-   **Hours by Phase:** If your project has phases, assign an hourly budget to each phase to track time spent individually.
-   **Fee by Phase:** If your project has phases, set a dollar budget for each phase to track costs at that granular level.

You can select your budget type when creating a new project by clicking on the “+” button in the top right corner and selecting “Add project” > “New project.”

![Screenshot of creating a project budget in Float with different budget types](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-of-creating-a-project-budget-in-Float-with-different-budget-types.png)

Once the project is up and running, you can see the total hours and money spent and compare it to the original budget using the “Projects” report to help you quickly identify projects at risk of exceeding budget.

![Screenshot of Project report in Float](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-of-Project-report-in-Float.png)

To see more detailed info for a specific project, click on the project name in the “Projects” table on the same page. 

This drills into that project’s full budget picture, including “Budget” “Scheduled “vs. “Logged” hours.

Depending on your chosen budget type, you can see the budget displayed in hours or currency.

![Screenshot of project details in Float](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screnshot-of-project-details-in-Float.png)

Alternatively, for a different view of ongoing project profitability and progress, clicking on the “Clients” tab lets you see the same data at a client level.

![Screenshot showing project budget details in Float](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-showing-project-budget-details-in-Float.png)

As your team logs time against their assigned tasks, Float automatically calculates the corresponding costs based on the applicable hourly rates. 

This can be the individual rate set for each team member or a project-specific rate if you’ve customized it for a particular project.

### What you’ll like

Float allows you to forecast project costs using “tentative” projects. 

Tentative projects allow you to model different scenarios and estimate costs without committing those projects to your official schedule.

By default, when you set a project as tentative, its associated phases, tasks, and allocations will also be marked as tentative. 

On the “Schedule” view, tentative allocations appear as colored outlines to distinguish them from confirmed projects.

![Screenshot showing tentative project in Float](https://www.scoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-showing-tentative-project-in-Float.png)

You will see a “User Rates” table within the same view. 

It shows their hourly cost based on salary, their billable rate for the project, the total internal cost and billable amount based on hours worked, and the resulting profit margin.

This information can help you make better decisions regarding resource allocation, pricing strategies, and project profitability.
